# Design and Development of an Assistive Architectural Support System

Mechanical, Electrical, and Embedded Control Integration (Arduino C++)

## Thesis Overview

This Master’s thesis focuses on the design, development, and validation of an assistive system aimed at improving architectural accessibility for people with disabilities.

The project integrates mechanical design, electrical systems engineering, and embedded control programming into a unified, functional prototype developed using Arduino (C++).
